# capstone-fpga-raytracing

This was our Final-year Design Project (Capstone) at the University of Toronto Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

The project is a [ray-tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) core that can be deployed on an FPGA. 
- Ray tracing is a widely-used technique in computer graphics to create realistic 3D images and animations. It is used extensively by companies like Pixar and Dreamworks.
- FPGAs are devices that can offer significant advantages in performance over traditional devices (CPUs/GPUs), due to their lower latency and higher power efficiency. They're used in High Frequency Trading to make faster investment decisions, and Microsoft uses them to accelerate [AI (Project Brainwave)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-brainwave/) and [Azure](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/21/azure_boost_network_accelerator/).

## Running this project
Clone the host, NewFPGA and NewHPS repos and follow README instructions for each. We're working to add more documentation.
